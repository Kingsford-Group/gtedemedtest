## Data Folder

This folder contains necessary script to generate and construct sequence sets for the experiments. 

### TCR seqs
The TCR sequences are generated by randomly combining and mutating reference V, D, J genes. See `simulated_TCR_seqs.py` for details. The orginal sequence sets that are used in the experiments in the manuscript can be found in `original_TCR_sets.tar.gz`.

### HBV seqs
The original sequence sets used in the manuscript can be found in `original_HBV_sets.tar.gz`.
